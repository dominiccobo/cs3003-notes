Do we test software understanding how it works or do we test software to see whether it does with what we expect it to do when we interact with it?

## Black Box

Black box testing implies the system as a subject is opaque. We cannot see into it.

## White Box

White box testing, more appropriately termed transparent or translucent testing, implies we can see the internal workings of a system and are concerned with creating test subjects from the various building blocks that form it to understand whether they work correctly or not.
